### 2026-06-04 — Project bootstrapped from plan
- Did: Received `PROJECT_PLAN.md` + `CLAUDE.md` + seeded `DECISIONS.md`. Repo not yet created.
- Tests: n/a (no code yet).
- Numbers: n/a.
- Issues: none.
- Next: Task 0.1 — create repo layout, `pyproject.toml` (pytest markers slow/gpu/lean), `Makefile`,
  pre-commit/ruff; commit; then Task 0.2 (Lean layer) and pin mathlib/Lean versions in `DECISIONS.md`.

### 2026-06-04 — Task 0.1 complete: repo + memory bootstrap, config loader, green fast suite
- Did: `git init` (branch `main`); built repo layout per §4 (`src/atp/{lean,models,agents,
  agents/components,search,budget,controller,data,eval}`, `tests/`, `slurm/`, `scripts/`,
  `results/`, `checkpoints/`, `logs/`, `scratch/{hf-cache,conda-envs,lean-cache}`). Added
  `.gitignore` (scratch/results/logs/checkpoints + python caches ignored; `.gitkeep`s kept).
  Wrote `src/atp/config.py` (pydantic-v2 typed loader: `defaults: base` deep-merge, `extra=forbid`
  validation, lossless round-trip, `config_hash`, `apply_env`→HF_HOME into scratch), `src/atp/cli.py`
  (no-op `prove`/`sweep` for `make smoke`), and subpackage `__init__`s. Created conda env at
  `scratch/conda-envs/atp` (python 3.11.15); installed LIGHT CORE + dev deps and the package editable
  `--no-deps`. Pinned versions in `pyproject.toml` + `DECISIONS.md`; split heavy GPU/Lean stack into
  `[gpu]`/`[lean]`/`[train]` optional groups (deferred — disk).
- Tests: `make test` (fast suite, `-m "not slow and not gpu and not lean"`) → **26 passed in 0.18s**.
  `make lint` (ruff) clean. `make smoke` runs the no-op pipeline OK (loads+validates config, sets
  HF_HOME, prints config hash).
- Numbers: env footprint 580 MB. No GPU-hours used.
- Issues: **`/insomnia001` is at 100% (only ~20 GB free on the 5 TB shared mount).** Deferred the
  full `torch`+`vllm`+`lean-dojo` install (~10–15 GB) and flagged to the team — need a go-ahead /
  disk cleanup before Task 0.2's Lean build. Light core was enough to get the fast suite green.
- Next: **STOP for check-in** (show tree + pins + test output). Then Task 0.2 — pin exact mathlib
  commit + Lean toolchain in `DECISIONS.md` BEFORE writing the Lean layer; flag both to the team.
